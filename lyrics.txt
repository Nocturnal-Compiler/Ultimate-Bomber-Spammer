Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah
I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness
You've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth
Hoping you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family
Watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me
But I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven
So I see you once again
My life was kinda short
But I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine
It sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy)
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed 
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)
I'm happy that you're here with me
I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger
You would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos
While walking through the park
You would jump into my arms
Every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets
Sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays went to church
On Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone
Sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
